# Styles

## Structure

1. `app.css` contains themed variables
2. Custom classes that could be globally consumed should be added to a `classes.css`
3. Each component has their own scoped styles

## Idea

- By having one global sheet I can normalize and theme the applicaiton
- By creating a global sheet with custom classes, I can add the classes only I would like to use
- The architecture of the layout should handle most of the spacing from top to bottom
