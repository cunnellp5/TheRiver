    longDescription: "A database is like a storage unit for all the information the website needs to remember. Even though Vercel holds the main code that runs the site, the database needs to live in a separate place that can be accessed anytime, from anywhere. This is where Supabase comes in—it's a cloud service that specializes in managing databases. It makes sure the website can easily connect to its stored information, no matter where it's hosted.",

It makes sure the website has a unique, easy-to-find name and keeps everything connected so people can reach the site on the internet. Otherwise we would have to use the deployed IP address to access the website",
