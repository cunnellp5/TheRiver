# Booking service workflow

1. User Selection of Service:

The user browses the available services offered by the artist and selects the service they wish to book. This selection might occur on the artist's website or app.

2. Authentication/Login:

If the user is not already logged in, they are prompted to authenticate or create an account. This step ensures that the booking is associated with the user's profile and allows for tracking of past and future bookings.

3. Navigating to Booking Page:

After selecting the desired service and logging in (if necessary), the user navigates to the booking page (/booking or similar) to schedule an appointment.

5. Selecting Date and Time:

On the booking page, the user is presented with options to choose a date and time for their appointment. This could be done using a calendar interface or a dropdown menu of available dates and times.

6. Checking Availability:

The system checks the availability of the selected date and time for the chosen service. It ensures that the selected slot is not already booked or unavailable due to scheduling constraints.

7. Confirming Booking Details:

Once the user selects a date and time, they review the booking details, including the selected service, date, and time. They may also have the option to add any additional notes or preferences.

8. Providing Contact Information:

The user provides their contact information, such as name, email address, and phone number, for appointment confirmation and communication purposes.

9. Payment (if applicable):

If the service requires payment, the user provides payment details and completes the transaction securely. This step may involve integrating with a payment gateway like Stripe to process payments.

10. Confirmation and Notifications:

After successfully booking the appointment, the user receives a confirmation message or email containing the details of their booking, including the service, date, time, and any other relevant information. Additionally, the artist or salon staff may receive a notification of the new booking.

11. Adding to Calendar (optional):

The user may have the option to add the appointment to their calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar) for easy reference and reminders.

12. Reminder and Follow-up:

As the appointment date approaches, the user may receive reminder notifications to ensure they don't miss their scheduled appointment. After the appointment, the artist or salon staff may follow up with the user for feedback or to schedule future appointments.
