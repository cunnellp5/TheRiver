      "My wish for the world is that we all take ourselves just a little less seriously and remember life is meant to be enjoyed. Inherently, there will be ups and downs... but do your best to have fun about itl. \n\nI wrote this song alone in a hotel room in LA. The only other thing I did that night was binge play animal crossing. What a life. We are dynamic in the human experience.. I had just spent the previous week on a cruise ship. It's a bit of a microcosm of sorts and the people were interesting. \n\nI was feeling carefree and I feel it translated into this song. I hope this song makes you feel like a bad b and I hope the video makes you feel .... something.\n Sincerely yours, The River.",
